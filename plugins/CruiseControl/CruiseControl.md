# CruiseControl

### Description
CruiseControl is a plugin that keeps your truck going at the speed limit using in-game ACC. Because it uses the in-game ACC, it can accelerate, brake and stop for other vehicles and obstacles.

### Usage
Enable the CruiseControl plugin and configure the setttings shown below.

### Configuration / UI
+++ General

!!!

Enabling this feature will accelerate to the target speed, which is the speed limit, even when the truck is standing still.
