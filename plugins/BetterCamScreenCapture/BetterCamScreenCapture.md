### Description

### Configuration / UI

```
  Width : The width of the image capture
 Height : The height of the image capture
      X : The X coordinate of the image capture
      Y : The Y coordinate of the image capture
Display : The display to capture from
 Device : The device to capture from
```

### Installation
This plugin will install the following python packages:
=== bettercam
Used for capturing the display.
===

### Exclusivity
This plugin is exclusive to the following types:
=== ScreenCapture
We only want one screen capturing plugin.
===

### Debugging
==- 'The specified device interface or feature level is not supported on this system.'
There are two cases in which this error happens:
1. You have a device that has an integrated GPU (for example on a laptop), and python is running on the dedicated GPU.
2. Your computer is too old to support the directx version dxcam needs.

***Fix for case 1:***

Go into your windows graphics settings, and set python.exe to run on the iGPU. (you might have to search for python.exe if it's not shown in the list)

A common location could be `C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311`

***Fix for case 2:***

Disable dxcam and enable mss in the plugin menu. Keep in mind that plugins are designed to run on dxcam, and not everything will work with mss.
