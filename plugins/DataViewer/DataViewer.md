### Description
This panel will show what stored in the `data` variable this frame.

### Configuration / UI
The UI includes one toggle to update the `data` or keep it the same. Keep in mind that updating the `data` is really heavy, so it will lower the FPS if the program a lot.

### Installation
The panel doesn't need any installation.
